# QuestionBot
Python trivia bot/pub quiz bot using spaCy

This program allows a user to enter a question. If properly punctuated, the program finds the Wikipedia page.
Once the Wikipedia page has been found, the keywords are looked for in the content of the page.
Then the sentence with the keywords is printed so the user has the answer.
